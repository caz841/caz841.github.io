     <h3>What is Humanimal Design?</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 "'>
          <p>Humanimal Design is the working title for an industry research project for my MA in Digital Experience Design. I am looking at the magic that happens (hopefully!) when we look inside the natural world and investigate problems and solutions with inter species empathy.</p>
          <p>Human Centred Design is now a common practise when designing new products and services, but what happens when we introduce multiple species into the design process? Whether the need comes from multi species stakeholders or trying to gain new perspective on a difficult problem what are the challenges and adaptations we need to make to our design practise to allow symbiotic and participatory design across species.</p>
          <p> There are numerous practical and ethical considerations that need to be taken into account and this is where this research stems from. I am keen to speak to anyone involved in animal welfare, animal assisted interventions, animal computer interaction and design that would be interested in being involved</p>

        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <div class="row">

          
             <article class="service col-md-4 col-sm-12">
                <img class="ol-image pic img-responsive" src="images/humanimaltrust.png" alt="Humanimal Trust and Prof Noel Fitzpatrick">
                <h4>Humanimal Trust</h4>
                <p>The Humanimal Trust was founded by SuperVet Noel Fitzpatrick. The primary focus of the trust is promoting the idea of #onemedicine that human and veterinary medicine can work together to the benefit of all as progress is being made on different areas in both sciences.</p>
                <p>One of the projects that is currently being worked on is looking to scientifically prove the health benefits of pets as therapy with the Southamption Hospital.</p>
                <p>I find the dedication of Prof Noel Fitzpatrick especially inspiring, he works tirelessly on behalf of animals and the benefits of the human animal bond. His recent collaboration with Channel 4 promoting adoption of pets from rescue centres raised the profile of this key issue.</p>

                <h4>Animal Welfare</h4>
                <p>Thousands of animals end up in shelters or rescue centres each year, I volunteer with the Border Collie Trust which is one such centre. Animals in these shelters deserve to find a happy and loving home, some of the stories of the dogs are heartbreaking, but the resilience and ability of animals to recover trust with the right conditions and care is incredible.</p>
                <p>There are many stories of how rescue dogs have helped people recovering from trauma and addictions, I find this synergy inspiring. A couple of examples of harnessing this power for the mutual benefit are the Symbiotic Behaviour Treatment Center in the US and also a scheme for schoolkids struggling with reading going to shelters to read to the dogs who are struggling to overcome shyness because of their experiences.</p>

                <h4>Animal Cognition</h4>
                <p>Animals have unique talents that we are finding more and more about. From examples of the medical detection dogs that can detect seisures twices as far in advance to modern technology to the Octopus that changes colour according to its mood the wonders of nature have much to teach us.</p>
                <p>I am particularly inspired by the work of Mark Bekoff into animal emotions. How we can harness the wonder of nature in an ethical and compassionate way fascinates me. I believe increased inter species respect and collaboration is key to creating harmonious experiences for all.</p>

                <h4>Animal Computer Interaction</h4>
                <p>Technology and innovation are moving forward at an ever increasing rate. In recent times this is also starting to change the human animal relationship. From consumer driven products such as Petcube to therapeutic uses such as the FIDO interaction vest technology is going to continue to alter the relationships of all living beings.</p>
                <p>I have been particularly inspired by the work in this sector on improving both animal welfare and animal assisted interventions, looking at the beneficial uses of technology to increase inter species understanding. A couple of great examples of work in this area I've come across are the Animal Computer Interaction lab in Milton Keynes and the FIDO project in Georgia, US.</p>
                <p>With dogs in particularly we are seeing increased collaborative working in therapeautic and survival settings some examples include Dementia Dogs, Search and Rescue Dogs and Medical Detection Dogs. We are also seeing an increased awareness of the environment in rescue centres has on the residents. How can technology and design help these situations?</p>

                <h4>Human Centred Design</h4>
                <p>Human Centred Design as a process is now well established, the recent rise of Experience Design that encompasses design as a discipline across the life span of products and services has enhanced the importance of this.</p>
                <p>At it's core Human Centred Design involves a deep understanding and empathy of the needs and problems of people from an emotional and practical perspective.</p>
                <p>In order to create products and services that are addressing needs across species it is necessary to develop this principle to empathise with all animals. How can this be done in an ethical and compassionate way without causing stress to any party?</p>
                <p>Some work I've found inspiring in this space is the dog persona work that has been done at UClan in Preston, UK and the phD research of Daniel Metcalfe into multi species design cards.</p>

                <h4>My Animals</h4>
                <p>All my life my animals have been a constant source of love, support and inspiration to me. Dogs, horses and cats have taught me so much about a huge range of subjects from behaviour through to Shiatsu. </p>
                <p>I came across Shiatsu when looking to help my pony Amber with the effects of arthritis, this opened up the world of traditional Chinese medicine to me, this along with the manifestation of energy in the body and how it relates to emotional and physical imbalances is a continued interest of mine.</p>
                <p>Poppy my Border Collie cross is a rescue, she is highly reactive to other dogs which has been a massive learning curve for me in terms of understanding and accounting for stress response in dogs and the parallels this has to stress responses in people. Poppy is the ultimate loyal companion, she loves to travel with me and we have some great adventures in my campervan.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 content">
        <p>Hello, I'm Caz Austen and I'm currently studying for a Masters degree at Hyper Island.</p>
        <p>Before returning to studying I had a long career in digital, starting off in design before moving into analytics and product management and leadership roles. If you're interested take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolineausten/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile here</a></p>
        <p>Having decided to move away from the corporate world I'm now looking to combine my skills in the areas I'm skilled in with areas I am passionate about. My ambition is to move towards working in anthrozoology but with a designers view, exactly what this might look like at this stage I'm still unsure but hopefully it'll involve being able to study deeply and understand both human and animal behaviour with the intention of bringing about positive change in the world developing harmonious inter species experiences.</p>
        <p>If you've got this far thank you for reading! I'd really like you to join me on my journey and I'm very keen to connect with anyone who's interested!</p>
