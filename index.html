          <h3>What is Humanimal Design?</h3>
          <p>Humanimal Design is my research project for my MA in Digital Experience Design from Hyper Island. I am looking the magic that happens when we look inside the natural world and investigate problems and solutions with a different mindset. <p/>
          <p>Human Centred Design is now a common practise when designing new products and services, but what happens when we introduce multiple species into the design process? Whether the need comes from multi species stakeholders or trying to gain new perspective on a difficult problem what are the challenges and adaptations we need to make to our design practise to allow symbiotic and participatory design across species.</p>
          <p> There are numerous practical and ethical considerations that need to be taken into account and this is where this research stems from. The research project has just started and I am currently investigating the areas of particpatory design, animal welfare, animal computer interaction and animal assisted interventions.</p>

        <h3>Story So Far</h3>
        <p>So far I have predominantly been creating a list of contacts that I'd like to speak to and doing some general reading on the subject. I've created this site as a place to give people a little bit of background and a chance to sign up for more information and to contact me.</p>
        <p>I have also signed up to volunteer at the Border Collie Trust in part to immerse myself in the study of animal behaviour which I believe is key to this process.</p>
        <p>Through the course of the research I aim to have prototyped a multi species design process, specifically focussing on how we can make this process participatory.</p>
        <p>This may include a prototype of a product or service to solve a specific problem or need, depending on the outcome of my initial investigations.</p>
