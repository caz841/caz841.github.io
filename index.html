     <h3>What is Humanimal Design?</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 "'>
          <p>Humanimal Design is the working title for an industry research project for my MA in Digital Experience Design. I am looking at the incredible insights that can be gained when we look inside the natural world and investigate problems and solutions with inter species empathy.</p>
          <p>Human Centred Design is now a common practise when designing new products and services, but what happens when we introduce multiple species into the design process? Whether the need comes from multi species stakeholders or trying to gain new perspective on a difficult problem what are the challenges and adaptations we need to make to our design practise to allow symbiotic and participatory design across species.</p>
          <p> There are numerous practical and ethical considerations that need to be taken into account and this is where this research stems from. I am keen to speak to anyone involved in animal welfare, animal assisted interventions, animal computer interaction or design that would be interested in being involved. If this is you please <a href="#social">get in touch</a>.</p>

             <h4>Humanimal Trust</h4>
                <img class="ol-image pic img-responsive" src="images/humanimaltrust.png" alt="Humanimal Trust and Prof Noel Fitzpatrick">
                
                <p><a href="http://www.humanimaltrust.org.uk" target="_blank">The Humanimal Trust</a> was founded by SuperVet <a href="http://www.noelfitzpatrick.vet" target="_blank">Professor Noel Fitzpatrick</a>. The primary focus of the trust is the idea of #onemedicine and facilitating cross-pollination of expertise and ideas between human and veterinary medicine. Their belief is that animal and human health are intrinsically linked and by working together we can preserve life for all species.</p>
                <p>One of the projects that is currently being worked on is looking to scientifically prove the health benefits of <a href="http://www.humanimaltrust.org.uk/2017/04/25/does-the-human-animal-bond-play-a-role-in-health-wellbeing/" target="_blank">animal assisted interventions</a> with Southamption Childrens Hospital and Pets as Therapy.</p>
                <p>I find the dedication of Prof Noel Fitzpatrick especially inspiring, he works tirelessly on behalf of animals and the benefits of the human animal bond. His recent collaboration with Channel 4 <a href="https://animalrescuelive.channel4.com" target="_blank">"Animal Rescue Live"</a> promoting adoption of pets from rescue centres has raised the profile of this key issue.</p>

              <h4>Animal Welfare</h4>
                <img class="ol-image pic img-responsive" src="images/vet.png" alt="Rescue Dogs and Veterans">
                
                <p>Thousands of animals end up in shelters or rescue centres each year, I volunteer with the <a href="http://www.bordercollietrustgb.org.uk" target="_blank">Border Collie Trust</a> which is one such centre. Some of the stories of the animals are heartbreaking, but the resilience and ability of animals to recover trust with the right conditions and care is incredible. Across the globe cruelty is happening to many species at the hands of humans from <a href="https://www.animalsasia.org/uk/" target="_blank">moon bears</a> in Vietnam to elephants beaten to provide tourist rides in Thailand.</p>
                <p>There are many stories of how rescue dogs have helped people recovering from trauma and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thedodosite/videos/1250304761770863/" target="_blank">addictions</a>, I find this synergy inspiring. A couple of examples of harnessing this power are the Symbiotic Behaviour Treatment Center in the US, founded by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK2HD9a2EjQ" target="_blank">Anthony Barnett</a> and also <a href="http://www.friendsofthedogs.org.uk/about-us.html" target="_blank">Cardiff Dogs Home</a> who have several initiatives including kennel and environment enrichment schemes.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.petfinder.com/pro/for-shelters/future-animal-shelters/" target="_blank">Innovation and technology</a> can help us to both shape improved design of products and services for animals being rescued and rehomed.</p>

              <h4>Animal Cognition</h4>
                <img class="col-image pic img-responsive" src="images/octopus.png" alt="Octopus">
                
                <p>Animals have unique talents that we are finding more and more about. From examples of the <a href="https://www.medicaldetectiondogs.org.uk" target="_blank">medical detection dogs</a> that can detect seizures twice as far in advance to modern technology to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G6eH1KDl0s" target="_blank">the octopus</a> which has a fantastic level of intelligence and changes colour according to its mood the wonders of nature have much to teach us. The <a href="https://www.dognition.com" target="_blank">Dognition</a> project is using community driven science to assess the cognitive capabilities of dogs. We have a lot to learn from non human animals if we open our senses.</p>
                <p>I am particularly inspired by the work of <a href="http://marcbekoff.com" target="_blank">Marc Bekoff</a> into animal emotions and the work of <a href="http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1049&context=acwp_awap" target="_blank">Prof Francoise Wemelsfelder</a> into creating a qualitative method of measuring animal emotions, the scientific world is increasingly becoming open to the idea that animals are sentient beings. How we can harness the wonder of nature in an ethical and compassionate way fascinates me. I believe increased inter species respect and collaboration is key to creating harmonious experiences for all.</p>

              <h4>Animal Computer Interaction</h4>
                <img class="ol-image pic img-responsive" src="images/aci.png" alt="Technology">
                
                <p>Technology and innovation are moving forward at an ever increasing rate. In recent times this is also starting to change the human animal relationship. From consumer driven products such as <a href="https://petcube.com" target="_blank">Petcube</a> to therapeutic uses such as the <a href="http://fido.gatech.edu" target="_blank">FIDO</a> interaction vest technology is going to continue to alter the relationships of all living beings.</p>
                <p>I have been particularly inspired by the work in this sector on improving both animal welfare and animal assisted interventions, looking at the beneficial uses of technology to increase inter species understanding. A couple of great examples of work in this area I've come across are the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/ACI/" target="_blank">Animal Computer Interaction</a> lab in Milton Keynes and the FIDO project (Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations) in Georgia, US.</p>
                <p>With dogs in particularly we are seeing increased collaborative working in therapeutic and survival settings some examples include <a href="http://www.dementiadog.org" target="_blank">Dementia Dogs</a>, <a href="http://www.nsarda.org.uk" target="_blank">Search and Rescue Dogs</a> and <a href="http://www.servicedogsuk.org" target="_blank">Service Dogs</a>. We are also seeing an increased awareness of the environment in rescue centres has on the residents. How can technology and design help these situations?</p>

              <h4>Human Centred Design</h4>
                <img class="ol-image pic img-responsive" src="images/hcd.png" alt="Human Centred Design">
                
                <p>Human Centred Design as a process is now well established, the recent rise of <a href="http://www.foolproof.co.uk/thinking/what-is-experience-design/" target="_blank">Experience Design</a> encompassing design as a discipline across the life span of products and services has enhanced the importance of this.</p>
                <p>At its core Human Centred Design involves a deep understanding and empathy of the needs and problems of people from an emotional and practical perspective.</p>
                <p>In order to create products and services that are addressing needs across species it is necessary to develop this principle to empathise with all animals. How can this be done in an ethical and compassionate way without causing stress to any party?</p>
                <p>Some work I've found inspiring in this space is the <a href="http://hci2017.bcs.org/wp-content/uploads/25.pdf" target="_blank">canine persona</a> work that has been done at UCLAN in Preston, UK and the phD research of <a href="http://danimetcalfe.com/index.php/md/" target="_blank">Daniel Metcalfe</a> into multi species design cards.</p>

              <h4>My Animals</h4>
                <img class="col-image pic img-responsive" src="images/Poppy.png" alt="Poppy - Collie Dog">
                
                <p>All my life my animals have been a constant source of love, support and inspiration to me. Dogs, horses and cats have taught me so much about a huge range of subjects from behaviour through to Shiatsu. </p>
                <p>I came across Shiatsu around 10 years ago when looking to help my old pony Amber with the effects of arthritis, this opened up the world of traditional Chinese medicine to me, the principles and philosphy behind this along with other theories around the manifestation of energy in the body and how it relates to emotional and physical imbalances is a continued interest of mine.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/poppy_dog_austen/" target="_blank">Poppy</a> my Border Collie cross is a rescue dog, she is highly reactive to other dogs which has been a massive learning curve for me in terms of understanding and accounting for stress response in dogs and the parallels this has to stress responses in people. Poppy is the ultimate loyal companion, she loves to travel with me and we have some great adventures in my campervan and yes she has her own instagram account.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-12 content">
        <p>Hello, I'm Caz Austen and I'm currently studying for a Masters degree at Hyper Island.</p>
        <p>Before returning to studying I had a long career in digital, starting off in design before moving into analytics and product management and leadership roles. If you're interested take a look at my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolineausten/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile here</a></p>
        <p>Having decided to move away from the corporate world I'm now looking to combine my skills in the areas I'm skilled in with areas I am passionate about. My ambition is to move towards working in anthrozoology and/or animal rescue with a designers view, exactly what this might look like at this stage I'm still unsure but hopefully it'll involve being able to study deeply and understand both human and animal behaviour with the intention of bringing about positive change in the world developing harmonious inter species experiences.</p>
        <p>If you've got this far thank you for reading! I'd really like you to join me on my journey and I'm very keen to connect with anyone who's interested!</p>
